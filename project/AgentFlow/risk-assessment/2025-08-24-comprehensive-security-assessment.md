## Security Architecture Recommendations

### Immediate Critical Fixes (Week 1-2)

#### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
```python
# Implement comprehensive input validation
class SecurityValidator:
    @staticmethod
    def sanitize_rag_query(query: str) -> str:
        # Remove dangerous patterns
        dangerous_patterns = [
            r"(?i)(ignore|override|system:|admin:)",
            r"(?i)(execute|run|eval|exec)",
            r"(?i)(show|return|output).*(all|everything|data)"
        ]
        for pattern in dangerous_patterns:
            if re.search(pattern, query):
                raise ValueError("Potentially malicious query detected")
        return query.strip()

    @staticmethod
    def validate_file_content(content: bytes) -> bool:
        # Implement content validation
        if len(content) == 0:
            return False
        # Check for malicious patterns
        return True
```

#### 2. JWT Security Hardening
```python
# Add proper JWT validation
class SecureJWTHandler:
    @staticmethod
    def create_secure_token(subject: str, settings) -> str:
        payload = {
            "sub": subject,
            "exp": datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=5),
            "jti": uuid4().hex,
            "aud": "agentflow-api",  # Add audience
            "iss": "agentflow-auth",  # Add issuer
            "iat": datetime.utcnow()  # Add issued at
        }
        return jwt.encode(
            payload,
            settings.secret_key,
            algorithm="HS256",
            headers={"kid": "agentflow-key-1"}  # Add key ID
        )

    @staticmethod
    def validate_token(token: str, settings) -> dict:
        try:
            payload = jwt.decode(
                token,
                settings.secret_key,
                algorithms=["HS256"],
                audience="agentflow-api",  # Validate audience
                issuer="agentflow-auth"     # Validate issuer
            )
            return payload
        except jwt.InvalidAudienceError:
            raise TokenError("Invalid token audience")
        except jwt.InvalidIssuerError:
            raise TokenError("Invalid token issuer")
```

#### 3. Rate Limiting Security
```python
# Fix IP detection and rate limiting
class SecureRateLimiter:
    @staticmethod
    def get_client_ip(request: Request) -> str:
        # Validate and sanitize forwarded headers
        forwarded_for = request.headers.get("X-Forwarded-For")
        if forwarded_for and SecureRateLimiter._is_trusted_proxy(request):
            # Take only the first IP and validate format
            client_ip = forwarded_for.split(",")[0].strip()
            if SecureRateLimiter._is_valid_ip(client_ip):
                return client_ip
        return request.client.host or "unknown"

    @staticmethod
    def _is_trusted_proxy(request: Request) -> bool:
        # Implement trusted proxy validation
        return True  # Placeholder - implement proper validation
```
