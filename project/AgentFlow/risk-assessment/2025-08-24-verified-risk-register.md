- **Current Controls**: Short token expiration (5 minutes), enhanced validation
- **Monitoring Required**: Token usage patterns, failed validation attempts

### VEC-001 (CVSS 8.5) - Collection Name Injection - PROTECTED
- **Risk Description**: Vector database collection name injection vulnerabilities
- **Impact**: Data corruption through malicious collection names
- **Likelihood**: Medium (insufficient validation)
- **Status**: **PROTECTED** - Enhanced with input validation layers
- **Current Controls**: Input sanitization, parameter validation
- **Monitoring Required**: Vector database access patterns

## Medium-Risk Vulnerabilities - ENHANCED CONTROLS

### AUTH-001 (CVSS 4.3) - Password Timing Attack - ENHANCED
- **Risk Description**: Potential password timing attack vulnerabilities

- **Likelihood**: Low (requires specialized attack)
- **Status**: **ENHANCED** - Secure password comparison implemented
- **Current Controls**: Constant-time password comparison

### CONF-001 (CVSS 6.5) - API Key Exposure - ENHANCED
- **Risk Description**: Potential API key exposure in logs or error messages
- **Impact**: Service compromise through key exposure
- **Likelihood**: Low (requires access to logs)
- **Status**: **ENHANCED** - Secure configuration management
- **Current Controls**: Environment variable protection, secure key handling

## Security Architecture - VALIDATED ✅
