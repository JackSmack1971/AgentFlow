## 3. Vulnerability Prioritization

### 3.1 Risk Assessment Methodology

**Risk Score Calculation:**
```
Risk Score = (Impact × Likelihood) × Exploitability
```

**Impact Factors:**
- **Critical (4.0):** Data breach, service disruption, compliance violation
- **High (3.0):** Significant functionality impact, sensitive data exposure
- **Medium (2.0):** Limited functionality impact, partial data exposure
- **Low (1.0):** Minimal impact, informational disclosure

**Likelihood Factors:**
- **High (1.0):** Exploitable by anonymous users, no authentication required
- **Medium (0.7):** Requires authentication, exploitable by authenticated users
- **Low (0.3):** Requires specific conditions, complex exploitation

**Exploitability Factors:**
- **High (1.0):** Public exploit available, easy to exploit
- **Medium (0.7):** Exploit possible with moderate skill
- **Low (0.3):** Requires advanced skills, complex exploitation

### 3.2 Priority Levels

**Critical Priority (Risk Score: 8.0 - 12.0):**
- **Timeline:** Address within 7 days
- **Resources:** Immediate attention, dedicated team
- **Communication:** Daily updates to executive leadership
- **Validation:** Independent security review required

**High Priority (Risk Score: 4.5 - 7.9):**
- **Timeline:** Address within 30 days
- **Resources:** Dedicated development resources
- **Communication:** Weekly updates to stakeholders
- **Validation:** Peer code review required

**Medium Priority (Risk Score: 2.0 - 4.4):**
- **Timeline:** Address within 90 days
- **Resources:** Scheduled development work
- **Communication:** Monthly status updates
- **Validation:** Standard code review process

**Low Priority (Risk Score: 0.1 - 1.9):**
- **Timeline:** Address within 180 days
- **Resources:** Best effort basis
- **Communication:** Quarterly review
