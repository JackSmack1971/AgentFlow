- Short expiration times (15 minutes for access tokens)
- Redis-based token blacklisting and revocation
- Two-factor authentication support with encrypted OTP secrets

**Code Quality**:
```python
# Secure JWT token creation with comprehensive claims
payload = {
    "sub": subject,
    "exp": datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=expiration_minutes),
    "jti": jti,  # Unique token identifier
    "aud": self.audience,  # Audience validation
    "iss": self.issuer,    # Issuer validation
    "iat": datetime.utcnow(),
    "nbf": datetime.utcnow(),
    "roles": roles or [],
    "session_id": session_id,
    "token_version": "1.0",
