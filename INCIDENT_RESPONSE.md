- [ ] **Team Training**: Regular incident response training
- [ ] **Contact Lists**: Maintain current contact information
- [ ] **Tools Ready**: Ensure incident response tools are available

#### Detection Capabilities
- [ ] **Intrusion Detection**: Network and host-based IDS configured
- [ ] **Log Analysis**: Security information and event management (SIEM)
- [ ] **Endpoint Monitoring**: Compromise indicators monitored
- [ ] **User Behavior Analytics**: Anomalous activity detection
- [ ] **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessments

### Phase 2: Identification

#### Detection Methods
1. **Automated Alerts**:
   - Security middleware triggers
   - Authentication failure spikes
   - Unusual traffic patterns
   - System resource exhaustion

2. **Manual Detection**:
   - User reports of suspicious activity
   - Security log review
   - Performance monitoring alerts
   - External security notifications

#### Initial Assessment
- [ ] **Confirm Incident**: Verify the security event is legitimate
- [ ] **Assess Scope**: Determine systems and data affected
- [ ] **Determine Impact**: Evaluate potential damage and exposure
- [ ] **Assign Severity**: Classify incident using severity matrix
- [ ] **Notify IRC**: Alert incident response coordinator

#### Documentation
- [ ] **Record Detection Time**: Document when incident was first detected
- [ ] **Document Indicators**: Record all indicators of compromise
- [ ] **Preserve Evidence**: Secure logs and system state for analysis

### Phase 3: Containment

#### Immediate Actions (Critical Incidents)
1. **Isolate Affected Systems**:
   ```bash
   # Disconnect compromised systems from network
   docker pause agentflow_api
   docker network disconnect internal agentflow_api

   # Block malicious IPs
   iptables -A INPUT -s MALICIOUS_IP -j DROP
   ```

2. **Stop Data Exfiltration**:
   ```bash
   # Kill suspicious processes
   pkill -f suspicious_process

   # Disable compromised accounts
   UPDATE users SET is_active = false WHERE id = compromised_user_id;
   ```

3. **Preserve Evidence**:
   ```bash
   # Create forensic images
   docker export compromised_container > forensic_image.tar

   # Copy logs before shutdown
   cp /var/log/security.log /evidence/security_log_backup
   ```

#### Short-term Containment
- [ ] **Network Isolation**: Disconnect affected systems from network

#### Communication
- [ ] **Internal Notification**: Alert incident response team
- [ ] **Stakeholder Awareness**: Notify management and legal teams
- [ ] **Status Updates**: Provide regular updates to stakeholders

### Phase 4: Eradication

#### Root Cause Analysis
- [ ] **Technical Analysis**: Determine how the incident occurred
- [ ] **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identify exploited vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Attack Vector Mapping**: Document the complete attack path
- [ ] **Compromise Indicators**: Identify all signs of compromise

#### System Cleanup
1. **Remove Malicious Code**:
   ```bash
   # Scan for malware
   find /app -name "*.malware" -delete

   # Clean compromised files
   git checkout -- compromised_files
   ```

2. **Close Vulnerabilities**:
   ```bash
   # Apply security patches
   pip install --upgrade security-package

   # Update configurations
   sed -i 's/insecure_setting/secure_setting/' config.yaml
   ```

3. **Rebuild Systems**:
   ```bash
   # Rebuild Docker images
   docker build --no-cache -t agentflow_api .

   # Reset secrets
   openssl rand -base64 32 > new_secret.key
   ```

#### Verification
- [ ] **Security Scanning**: Run vulnerability scans on cleaned systems
- [ ] **Integrity Checks**: Verify file integrity using known good backups
- [ ] **Access Review**: Audit all system and user accounts
- [ ] **Log Review**: Check for additional compromise indicators

### Phase 5: Recovery

#### System Restoration
1. **Gradual Service Restoration**:
   ```bash
   # Start services in isolated environment
   docker run -d --network isolated agentflow_api

   # Monitor for compromise indicators
   tail -f /var/log/security.log | grep -E "(SECURITY_VIOLATION|SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY)"
   ```

2. **Data Recovery**:
   ```bash
   # Restore from clean backup
