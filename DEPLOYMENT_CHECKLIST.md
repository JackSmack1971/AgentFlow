# Check environment variables
grep -E "(FERNET_KEY|JWT_SECRET_KEY|SECRET_KEY)" .env

# Validate security settings
python -c "from apps.api.app.config.settings import get_settings_instance; print('Settings loaded successfully')"

# Test encryption
python scripts/demo_encryption.py
```

### Post-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Test authentication endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"wrong","otp_code":"123456"}'

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..10}; do curl -s http://localhost:8000/health; done

# Check security headers
curl -I http://localhost:8000/health

# Validate security logs
tail -f logs/security.log
```

### Security Health Checks
```bash
# Check Redis security state
docker exec agentflow_redis redis-cli --scan

# Validate database security
docker exec agentflow_postgres pg_isready

# Check container security
docker inspect agentflow_api | grep -E "(User|SecurityOpt)"
```

## Emergency Security Procedures
