# AgentFlow Threat Model

## Overview

This threat model identifies potential security threats to the AgentFlow system, their likelihood, impact, and current mitigation strategies. The analysis follows STRIDE methodology (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).

## System Context

**AgentFlow Components:**
- FastAPI web application
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis cache/session store
- Docker container orchestration
- JWT-based authentication
- TOTP two-factor authentication
- RBAC authorization system

**Data Flow:**
1. User authenticates via web interface
2. API validates credentials and issues JWT tokens
3. Client uses tokens for subsequent API calls
4. Services communicate internally via Docker network
5. Sensitive data encrypted at rest
