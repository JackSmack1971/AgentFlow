# Git Workflow Guidelines

## Commit Strategy
- Make atomic commits with clear, descriptive messages
- Stage only relevant changes for each commit
- Use conventional commit format when project specifies it
- Always verify clean working directory before task completion

## Branch Management
- Work exclusively on the current branch
- Never create, switch, or delete branches
- Respect any branch protection rules or naming conventions

## Conflict Resolution
- If merge conflicts occur, resolve them following project conventions
- Prioritize maintaining code quality and consistency
- Document conflict resolution rationale in commit messages when significant
