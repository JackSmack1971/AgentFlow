# Citation Standards and Requirements

## File Citations
Format: `【F:<filepath>†L<linestart>(-L<lineend>)?】`
- Use for referencing code changes, documentation, or configuration files
- Ensure file paths are relative to repository root
- Include specific line numbers for precise references
- Prefer file citations over terminal citations for code-related content

## Terminal Citations  
Format: `【<chunkid>†L<linestart>(-L<lineend>)?】`
- Use for referencing command outputs, test results, or build logs
- Only cite lines with actual content (skip empty lines)
- Include context necessary for understanding the cited output
- Prefer for validation steps and verification processes

## Citation Best Practices
- Cite immediately after relevant claims or statements
- Ensure cited content directly supports the preceding text
- Use ranges (L1-L10) for multi-line references when appropriate
- Maintain accuracy in line numbering and chunk identification
