# Infrastructure and Operations Strategy

## Container Strategy

### Multi-Stage Docker Builds
```dockerfile
# Development stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS development
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]

# Production stage  
FROM node:18-alpine AS production
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force
COPY --from=development /app/dist ./dist
USER node
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
## Kubernetes Deployment Strategy

Rolling Updates: Zero-downtime deployments with proper readiness/liveness probes
Auto-scaling: HPA and VPA for dynamic resource management
Service Mesh: Istio/Linkerd for traffic management and security
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger for comprehensive observability

## Team Integration and Coordination

### Workflow Integration Matrix

| Mode | Coordinates With | Integration Points |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Git Manager** | All team members | Central coordination hub |
| **Code Reviewer** | Git Manager, Security Auditor | PR reviews, quality gates |
| **CI/CD Manager** | Git Manager, DevOps Engineer, Security Auditor | Pipeline coordination |
| **Doc Manager** | Git Manager, Project Manager | Documentation updates |
| **Security Auditor** | All team members | Security reviews and compliance |
| **Project Manager** | All team members | Planning and coordination |
| **DevOps Engineer** | CI/CD Manager, Security Auditor | Infrastructure and monitoring |

### Team Communication Protocol
```yaml
# Example coordination workflow
1. Project Manager creates milestone and assigns work
2. Git Manager coordinates development workflow with GitDoc
3. Code Reviewer provides quality feedback on PRs
4. Security Auditor validates security requirements  
5. CI/CD Manager handles automated deployment
6. DevOps Engineer monitors production systems
7. Doc Manager updates documentation for releases
